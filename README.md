# resume-html
Build resume using HTML, CSS

This project uses HTML, CSS, bootstrap, font-awesome icons, Google font - Rubik to build a web page.
The page will convert to a A4 page on print. You can save it as PDF.
NOTE: The web page and print preview might look different. The print page is what matters.

Tweak and make designs with this base setup. Enjoy.
